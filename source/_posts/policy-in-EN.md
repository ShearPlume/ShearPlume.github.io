*This policy framework uses SESM (Social Engineering through Social Media)[1] and is developed from three aspects: people, process and technology*

#### People Policy.

Employees must attend regular training sessions on information security breaches, and the company will provide different levels of training for different employee positions with different levels of exposure to the risk of information breaches.

Employees must create strong, unbreakable passwords for non-personal accounts on messaging services.

Penalties (e.g. deduction of quarterly bonuses, etc.) are imposed on employees who lose corporate information as a result of using personal communication services, and rewards are given to employees who strictly comply with the company's bylaws.

Prohibit employees from making statements in the communication service that damage the company's reputation or make inappropriate comments on other articles or media.

Employees must observe the following restrictions when using company information in personal information services or personal blogs:

What company intellectual property can be used? What can be talked about the company's products and services? What company secrets or other information could be posted?

#### Process Policy.

The company must classify personal, professional and corporate accounts in the communication service and enhance technical security for non-personal accounts.

The security department must classify the security level of internal company information files, stipulating that files with a security level higher than a certain level should not be allowed to be shared or transmitted by employees using personal communication services, but should instead be transmitted using more secure means. (e.g., in physical form or using a secure communication service)

Employees' access, modification, storage and deletion of sensitive corporate information must be documented and recorded in the access log.

To prevent outside attempts to hack into network accounts, internal company accounts are locked out after five failed login attempts.

New communication services software for all personal terminals, desktops and laptops in the company must be approved by IT management.

In the event of a breach of information or a cyber attack, the response team should be the first to minimize the damage.

#### Technology Policy.

Enterprises have the right to use internal network devices to log web services and user logins in applications.

Enterprises must perform breakpoint assessments and BYOD[2] (Bring Your Own Device) detection on devices that have access to the company's network firewall

Regular intrusion detection and prevention of intrusion on critical servers in the enterprise.

Enterprises should conduct security assessments of relevant personal information service software to test its security

Enterprises must encrypt key customer and company information in the following steps: creation, transport, use, storage and destruction

Companies must review third-party software and APIs.
